            <h2>Information about Blacks Beach</h2>
<p>Blacks Beach is one of San Diego's hidden gems. The beach is also one of the hardest to get to. Located north of La Jolla Shores, there is no main entrance, and no parking lot nearby. The entrance is located off of La Jolla Farms road, an affluent neighborhood where celebrities like Alicia Keys own properties. Beach goers can park on the street and walk to the entrance. The entrance leads you to a half mile, downhill walk to the beach. Be aware, Blacks beach is a nude beach, so it might not be a family beach. However, it is known as one of the best surf breaks in the nation. An underwater canyon offshore channels waves into perfectly formed sections when the right swell comes through. Surfers flock to the beach when a good swell comes in. The million dollar mansions lofted on the massive cliffs overlooking the beach, combined with clear water, good surf, and frequent dolphin sightings make this one of the most epic surf spots in the country.</p>
