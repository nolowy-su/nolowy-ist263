                <p>La Jolla Shores is one of the most visited beaches in San Diego, so parking can be hectic. Expect to spend a long time finding parking on busy days like weekends and holidays and around peak times of the day. Also anticipate to see lots of other surfers in the water, so make sure you take extra caution to protect the safety of yourself and others. If you want to avoid the crowd, try to get there at sunrise. Consider riding a higher volume board, since this spot tends to produce more conditions conducive to beginning surfers.</p></div>

                <p>The trickiest part about surfing at Blacks is getting there. You can walk down from several ways, a treacherous hike from the Torrey Pines Gliderport, parking on La Jolla Farms Road and walking down a half mile road, or walking North from Scripps Pier at low tide. Once you get there, get ready for an epic session. With the right swell, Blacks can produce incredibly clean waves, and on bigger days, perfect barreling a-frame waves. Beware of the locals, however. Blacks Beach regulars tend to be territorial over this majestic spot, so try not to get in their way.</p></div>
