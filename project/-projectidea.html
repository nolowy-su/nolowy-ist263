Content Plan due 9/5/20
        I plan to build a website dedicated to providing people with information about surfing and beaches in Southern California. 
        The pages would each describe a beach, things to do in the area, an overview of the beach itself and information about the surfing at the beach. The website would feature images from the internet and I would embed links to surf reports and surf cams so people could use the website as a resource to check the waves before they go surfing there. 
        One page would be about Blacks Beach, another would be about Del Mar, and the last would be about Pacific Beach. All of these are famous beaches in San Diego and each page would feature images, the surf reports/cams and also some insider tips and advice for going there, things to do around there and helpful surfing tips for each beach.
